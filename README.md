# GRPC Services and Registry

## Task 1 & 2 Readme
### To run with defaults
gradle runClientJava --console=plain
To run with auto enabled use -Pauto=1
To run node with defaults:
gradle runNode
Please note that EchoClient still takes a message parameter, and a message can be set with -Pmessage=[message]. However, the client does not use this input. Message functionality for echo is available in the main menu. The parameter was left there so you can test the client using the shell commands you expect.

To use the client simply follow the prompts.
